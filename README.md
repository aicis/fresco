FRESCO
======

FRESCO is a *FRamework for Efficient and Secure COmputation*, written
in Java and licensed under the open source MIT license.

The framework is separated as follows:

* core: contains the FRESCO core which is needed in order to run applications.
* demos: contains demonstrators (i.e. FRESCO applications) which shows examples
of how to run a FRESCO application and shows off a few of the simple
applications such as private set intersection and private distance
computation. It also shows the ease of switching between the different
multiparty computation protocol suites implemented in FRESCO.
* tools: contains various tools which could be useful for using FRESCO.

The FRESCO documentation is available at
[http://fresco.readthedocs.org](http://fresco.readthedocs.org/).

If you have any comments, questions, ideas, or find bugs, send us an
email at fresco@alexandra.dk or use the FRESCO issue tracker at
[http://github.org/aicis/fresco/issues](http://github.org/aicis/fresco/issues/).
We will be happy to integrate code that fits into the overall design
of FRESCO.
