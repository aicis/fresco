/**
 * ProtocolBuilders provide a more natural interface than working with raw Protocols
 * when writing secure computation applications. The goal is to have a more "code-like" 
 * way of specifying the Protocol. 
 * 
 * To build a Protocol the application programmer 
 * calls methods on a ProtocolBuilder corresponding to the operations the final Protocol 
 * should apply to given SInts. Behind the scenes the ProtocolBuilder constructs the corresponding
 * Protocol and returns the corresponding ProtocolProducer when needed. 
 * 
 * I.e. ProtocolBuilders hides away the raw Protocol and (to some extend) its structure, and lets
 * the application programmer work solely with Values.
 * 
 * The ProtocolBuilder interface provides general methods for controlling the structure of
 * the Protocol, i.e. to specify whether the computation can be done in parallel or must be 
 * done sequentially. To switch between parallel and sequential Protocol building one sets declares 
 * a "scope" for a sequence of instructions.
 * 
 * TODO: Eventually ProtocolBuilders could maybe also be used to analyze and optimize the Protocols
 * that they have been building.
