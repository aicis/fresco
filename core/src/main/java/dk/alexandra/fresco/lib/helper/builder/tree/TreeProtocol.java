/**
 * Represents a generic tree structured protocol used to apply an operation to
 * all elements in a list.
 * 
 * An example could be a protocol computing the AND or XOR of all bits in an
 * list or array. This can be done in a generic tree fashion in log(size of
 * list) depth given simply the length of the list. 
 * 
 * The concrete operation to be done on elements is specified by a
 * TreeprotocolNodeGenerator. The TreeprotocolNodeGenerator generates a a protocol
 * corresponding to the operation on two elements given the indicies of these
 * elements in the underlying list.
 * 
 * This class does not explicitly hold the data it simply generates the
 * appropriate protocol based on correct indexing to the
 * TreeprotocolNodeGenerator. Usually the data will be held by the
 * TreeprotocolNodeGenerator.
