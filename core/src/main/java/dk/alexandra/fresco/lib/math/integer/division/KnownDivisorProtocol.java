/**
 * This protocol is an implementation Euclidean division (finding quotient and
 * remainder) on integers with a secret shared divedend and a known divisor. In
 * the implementation we calculate a constant <i>m</i> such that multiplication
 * with <i>m</i> will correpsond to the desired division -- just shifted a
 * number of bits to the left. To get the right result we just need to shift
 * back again.
 * 
 * The protocol does <code>maxInputLength + log(divisor)</code> shifts, and this
 * being the heaviest operation, keeping these numbers small will improve
 * performance.
