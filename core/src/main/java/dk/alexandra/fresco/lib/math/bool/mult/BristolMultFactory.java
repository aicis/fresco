/**
 * Factory for various mulitplication operations.
 * 
 * The factory is based on a factory for AND, XOR, NOT gates. It reads a full
 * description of a boolean circuit from a static file.
 * 
 * It is based on a static circuit description produced by Nigel Smart and
 * others, see https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Research/CryptographySecurity/MPC/. The
 * circuit has been optimized such that it contains only a small number of
 * non-linear gates (AND gates) at the cost of more linear gates (XOR, NOT)
 * gates.
 * 
 * There is a certain amount of streaming here: The circuit description is
 * loaded into memory in a streamed manner. When getNextProtocols() is invoked,
 * new Xor and And protocols and SBools are constructed in a lazy manner.
 * However, nothing is garbage collected, so at the end of the getNextGates, the
 * full circuit is present in memory.
 * 
 * OBS: A new read of the file is done at every call to the factory. Might be
 * more efficient to load file once and generate protocols based on that.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: The circuit here ignores padding and only allows a single-block
 * input. Each circuit implements the compression function of the respective
 * hash function, where the input chaining values are fixed to the IV values of
 * the respective hash function. The input of the circuit is a full-size message
 * block, the output consists of chaining values after invocation of the
 * compression function (formatted in the same way as the digest value would be
 * in the respective hash function). This means that non-standard test vectors
 * are used, see https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Research/CryptographySecurity/MPC/.
