/**
 * A protocol suite based on Yao's garbled circuit approach.
 * 
 * This implementation uses the Yao stuff in SCAPI.
 * 
 * No streaming (as streaming is not supported by SCAPI yao).
 * 
 * This is an example of a suite with evaluational dependence (?).
 * 
 * We simply build the SCAPI circuit data structure (BooleanCircuit) in its entirety
 * in memory during FRESCO eval.
 * 
 * TODO: Perhaps garbling is done during FRESCO eval?
 * 
 * Then, at finishedEval() we launch the SCAPI protocol.
